Him: 
Small sample project that demonstrates how to create custom UITableView cells that expand when you select them. 
Each cell also has two buttons in them that are assigned custom functionality that is unique to each cell.

Me:
I edited his code to allow varying sizes of the expanded cell and did some refactoring for the higher iOSs.
Clicking the selected cell will collapse it now also.
